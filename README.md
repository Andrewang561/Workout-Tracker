# Escaping the Maze Proposal

### What is the Application?

The application I want to create is a puzzle game in which the user tries to figure out a pathway to escape the randomly generated maze. 
The user types commands such as "W A S D" into the console which the character within the game follows. The goal is to figure
out a pathway that leads to the exit of the maze within a specific time frame.


### Who will use it?

Anyone can play this game but the target audience is for **people who enjoy playing games and want a 
fun challenge**. I want to create a game that I find enjoyable and would want other people to experience as well. 

### Why this Application?

The choice of studying computer science was inspired by my love of games since childhood. My dream is to work at a tech company that produces video games such as EA or Riot Games.
I figured the first step to achieving my dream would be to create a small game that I could show to 
future employers that I have the capabilities to help produce games.
