# MyFitnessTracker

### What is the Application?

The application I want to create is a fitness tracker that users will be able to log and track their workout
routines. They are able to select what muscle group they have worked on (*ex.* Shoulders and Biceps), and input
what type of workout they did, for how many repetitions, weight used, etc. The fitness application
will be able to keep track of it all so users know what progress is made/being lost. 


### Who will use it?

The application is designed for **people who are into fitness and health and want to improve
their approach toward the gym**. By keeping track of workouts and weights, users have a better understanding
on their growth and whether or not they have been actively improving. Signs of stagnation could indicate
lack of rest or insufficient consumption of protein. This is just one of many benefits
my application that people who are passionate about fitness will love.

### Why this Application?

I am an active gym goer and one of the main issues I experience is that I often
forget how many repetitions and what weights I used previously. This resulted in my growth
becoming stagnant as I am not pushing myself to use heavier weights. This application would be a great
asset in my gym experience and I am sure others would love it as well.
